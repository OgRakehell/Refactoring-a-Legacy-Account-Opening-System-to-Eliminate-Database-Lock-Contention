# Lessons Learned
- Databases are coordination tools, not workflow engines

- Synchronous designs fail silently under scale

- Idempotency is a prerequisite, not an enhancement

- Backpressure is a feature, not a limitation

- Stability emerges from boring, explicit systems

# Conclusion
This refactor transforms a fragile, lock-prone legacy application into a controlled, observable, and scalable system.

The system no longer relies on hope, refresh buttons, or heroics.
It relies on clear contracts, short transactions, and deliberate flow control.
